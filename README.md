Just updated the repo âœ¨ I've created `telegram.py` housing all functions for easier usage.

Check out ðŸ¤– [`MyOTP!`](https://www.t.me/myotprobot) telegram bot for easy login using a Telethon session string.


## Features
- Create Telethon and Pyrogram sessions.
- Login to telegram app using Telethon session file.
- Scrape members' info such as name, username, etc.
- Retrieve all user created groups and channels.


## Installation

1. Download the `telegram.py` script and `requirements.txt` file from this repository.
2. Navigate to your project directory in the terminal.
3. Run the following command to install dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:
  
  ```sh
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

   - Make sure that both `telegram.py` script and `requirements.txt` file are in the same directory as your main script.
   - You're all set! You can now import and use all functions within `telegram.py`
