Just updated the repo âœ¨ I've created `telegram.py` housing all functions for easier usage.

Check out ðŸ¤– [`MyOTP!`](https://www.t.me/myotprobot) telegram bot for easy login using a Telethon session string.


## Features
- Create Telethon and Pyrogram sessions.
- Login to telegram app using Telethon session file.
- Manage account settings, including viewing connected devices, listing created groups/channels, and updating 2FA.


## Installation

1. Download both the `telegram.py` script and the `requirements.txt` file from this repository.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt. Use `cd` to navigate to the directory where youâ€™ve saved the downloaded files.
3. Run the following command to install dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:
  
  ```sh
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

   - Make sure that both the `telegram.py` script and the `requirements.txt` file are located in the same directory as your main project script.

Once installed, you can import and use all the available functions from the telegram.py script in your project.
